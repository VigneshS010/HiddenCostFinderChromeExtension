# Hidden Cost Finder Chrome Extension
Overview
This Chrome extension is designed to detect hidden costs or dark patterns on e-commerce websites like Amazon, Flipkart, and others. It helps users by identifying additional charges (such as hidden shipping fees, taxes, and other expenses) that may not be clear during the purchasing process and displaying them prominently on the extension's interface.

Features
Automatic Detection: Scans popular e-commerce sites for hidden costs and dark patterns during the checkout process.
User-Friendly Display: The identified hidden costs are shown directly in the extension popup for easy access.
Support for Multiple Sites: Currently optimized for major websites like Flipkart and Amazon, with more websites to be added in the future.
How It Works
The extension automatically analyzes the webpage when the user visits a supported e-commerce site.
It extracts potential hidden fees or extra costs that might appear during the checkout or product browsing phases.
These costs are then displayed within the extensionâ€™s interface, giving the user clarity about the true total price.
